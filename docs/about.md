# About TrySpace

TrySpace is a space software and systems engineering company founded to accelerate space mission development through open-source tools, software digital twins, and mission-first engineering.

## Mission & Philosophy

To democratize access to high-quality space system development tools through pragmatic, open-source, software-first infrastructure that scales from CubeSats to interplanetary missions.

## Founder Background

TrySpace was founded by a NASA systems engineer and software developer with over a decade of experience in embedded systems, flight software, and simulation infrastructure.

Key contributions include CryptoLib and the NASA Operational Simulator for Small Satellites (NOS3) — tools trusted across multiple NASA missions for rapid prototyping, testing, and operations.

## What We Do

- Software-only digital twins for space systems
- End-to-end mission simulation and architecture
- Custom tools for flight and ground systems
- Integration and support for open-source space software
- Systems engineering and technical consulting

## Why TrySpace?

Because building for space is hard.
We believe it should be easier to try, test, and fly — and software is the key.
TrySpace is here to lower the barrier, increase reuse, and enable your mission to launch smarter.
