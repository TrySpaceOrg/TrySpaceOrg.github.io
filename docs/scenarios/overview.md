# Scenarios

The various scenarios are designed to mimic those one may see while operating a space vehicle:

* [Commissioning](commissioning.md)
* [Nominal Operations](nominal-operations.md)
* [Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery](fdir.md)
* [Security](security-incident-response.md)

Each of these scenarios contains an objective, prerequisites, and and overview before getting started.
